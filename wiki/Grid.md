A grid helps to align tokens added to the map. Any token added to a map with a grid will default to the grid size. 

## Creating the grid

Click on the `Add Grid` button at the bottom to open the grid configuration menu.

Move the blue square so that it contains at least one square of your map. This square selects the area that you will zoom into to make your final selection. You can adjust the size of the blue square if needed. Click next and you will see a zoomed view of your map.

Select one square of your map and click next. Finally, you can fine tune the dimensions of your grid to fit the map. If you know the pixel width of one square in your original image you can input it to the `side length` box. Click finish when you are done.

You can adjust the visibility of the grid for both you and the players. The sliders adjust the color and transparency of the grid.
