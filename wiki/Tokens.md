Tokens are shapes that can be added to the map representing things such as creatures, players, items, area effects, notes or anything else you can think of.

Click on the token tool on the left and then click somewhere on the map that you want to place a token. The token size will default to the grid size if it is present. Right click on a token to edit it. From the token menu you can name the token, change its size and color, hide/show the token to players, and link a note.

Tokens visible to players can also be moved by them. Click the `Lock` button at the bottom of the token menu to lock it in place.

Linking a note to a token can be useful for the DM. You can use it for creature/player stats, item descriptions, room notes, or anything else you can think of. Click the `Link` button to link a note to the token. You can choose an existing note or create a new one. See the [Notes](https://github.com/maxb2/dungeon-revealer/wiki/Notes) page for more details.
